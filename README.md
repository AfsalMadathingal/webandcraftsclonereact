I just started learning React and have seen this website before. I was impressed by the quality and design, so I decided to clone it for practice. This project helped me gain more knowledge about React.



Currently, the website can only be viewed from a desktop as I haven't made it responsive yet. I created it within a day and did my best. In the future, I hope to build more efficient websites.
